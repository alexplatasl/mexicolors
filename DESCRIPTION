Description: A crisp, clean color palette generator inspired by Mexican politics, with colors ranging from 
    blue on the left to gray in the middle and red on the right. A variety of palettes allow for a range of
    applications from brief discrete scales (e.g., three colors for Morena, PRI, PRD, and PAN) 
    to continuous interpolated arrays including dozens of shades graded from blue (left) to red (right).
