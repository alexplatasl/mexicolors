Description: A color palette generator inspired by Mexican politics, with 
    colors ranging from red on the left to gray in the middle and green on the 
    right. Palette options range from only a few colors to several colors, but with
    discrete and continuous options to offer greatest flexibility to the user. 
    This package allows for a range of applications, from mapping brief discrete scales 
    (e.g., four colors for Morena, PRI, and PAN) to continuous interpolated arrays 
    including dozens of shades graded from red to green.
